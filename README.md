# phantomjscloud-node-examples

## abstract

some examples showing how to use the [PhantomJsCloud](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phantomjscloud) npm package.

if you have any additional examples, please feel free to either email them to jasons@phantomjscloud.com or submit a pull request.

conversely, if you need an example of something, feel free to open an [issue on github](https://github.com/Novaleaf/phantomjscloud-node-examples/issues) and Jason will try to help out.

The examples are written in Typescript, but the output javascript (under ```./dist/```) is highly readable.

## installation


1. download:  ```npm install phantomjscloud-examples``` or pull the repository from github
2. ```npm install``` to install the prerequisite ```phantomjscloud``` module.
3. browse to the desired ```./built/basic/*``` file and read the code

## run

you can run the various examples from the root directory in this way:

- ```node ./built/basic/post-request.js```
- ```node ./built/basic/capture-pdf.js```
- ```node ./built/basic/capture-pdf-promise.js```
- ```node ./built/basic/capture-plaintext-promise.js```

- check the ```./built/``` folder structure for any other (new) examples too.
